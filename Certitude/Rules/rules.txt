Volume based rules
 
- Volume of event type/class per User ID per rolling time
- Sum of Event Data per User ID per rolling time per event type/class
- Volume of User ID per User ID per rolling time (e.g. IPs per username, usernames per IP)
- Volume of user activity per rolling time per event type/class
 
Behavior based rules
 
- Volume of user activity per rolling time, compared to average user activity per user (1st/99th centile)
- Time of day of user activity, compared to usual user activity
- User ID is 1st or 99th centile in sign-in frequency (e.g. how unusual is one sign-in per day)
- X number of event type/class recorded within rolling time of event type/class  (e.g. change of email address and change of phone number the day before a change of password)
- First X characters of Event data not seen in last X days (e.g. sort code not used in last 12 months)
- User behaviour changed when compared to previous block (e.g. chunk data into weekly/monthly/quarterly blocks and see if the behaviour this block is different to those blocks)
 
Fixed rules
 
- Value of individual payment per instance
- Event type/class is X and event data is on black list/is not on white list
- value in notification is within x meters of a given geographical point
